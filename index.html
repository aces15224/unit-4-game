    <p> My name is Anthony Martin.  I'm an aspiring web developer and, although I'm new to the trade, a penchant for learning and hardwork is a part of my code.  
        Everyday I am learning more about the subject and everyday I am practicing to refine my skills.  Soon I'll master HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  Maybe I'll use 
        that knowledge to conquer the world.  Maybe I'll make a cool website.  It's possible I'll even aquire enough knowledge to understand "floats".
    </p>
    <p>I like to read, and write, and I'm a huge movie buff.  I like to read, and write, about movies too.  I'm very interested in how scripts are written, how certain 
        filming techniques communicate ideas and feelings, and the themes that are explored in the background.  With what I've learned, I hope to develop websites and 
        applications that are entertaining and creative and maybe even informative.
